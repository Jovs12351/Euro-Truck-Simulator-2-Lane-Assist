### How can I help
We are especially looking for people with experience in **Python** and/or **Unity**. The project is entirely open source so you can create your own fork and then merge your changes to the main application once you are done. There is a list of our repositories below for easy access.

If you don't have a development background you can still help! All of our translations are done by the community, for this purpose we have [instructions on our website](https://ets2la.com/guides/translation/manual/) on how to do this. It's quite simple and anyone with a basic understanding of text editing should be able to do it.

### Why make ETS2LA?
> Okay so I don't mean to spam this channel with my absolute excitement for this program, because I have already told you guys how much I love it, but I think it bears repeating one more time that I am in a wheelchair and do not have the manual dexterity to play this game on my own and it is ONLY because of this program that I am able to play the game! I absolutely love it and I really want the developers to know that I appreciate all their hard work into making this program. There is a sense of satisfaction that comes from being able to drive in a simulator when I can't even do it in the real world because of my disability. ðŸ™‚
